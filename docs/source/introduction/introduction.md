# Introduction

<br>

The aim of these pages is to ensure that each prospective client/collaborator carefully considers the time commitment, collaboration commitment, cost, range of expertise, project details, etc., that are required for a business machine learning project. 

<br>

A project's details are especially critical to conducting a well-informed technical feasibility & economic 
viability assessment before proceeding.  It is also important to beware that the data science aspect of the project is only a part of the project, ignoring this leads to [project failures](https://www.kdnuggets.com/survey-machine-learning-projects-still-routinely-fail-to-deploy) due to, e.g.,

<ul>
    <li class="disc">Under-planning.</li>
    <li class="disc">Ambiguous project scope/design details.</li>
    <li class="disc">Project pilots that are neither informed by <b>nor</b> tests the deployment goal.</li>
    <li class="disc">Underestimating, or ignoring, cost.</li>
    <li class="disc">Ignoring the critical importance of intensive collaboration between the business, data science, operations, etc.,
teams.</li>
</ul>

One of the first sections of these pages is **Deployment Goal**.  Colleagues may question why.  Here are a few references that 
capture our experience of why business data science projects fail, and the advantages of starting with ``the end in mind'' [^deployment]
